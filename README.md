Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets you to the Philosophy article. The unreachable links refer to an article with no wikilinks or with links to pages that do not exist (highlighted in red), or get stuck in loops (highlighted in orange).

Following the chain consists of:
1. Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link
2. Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links
3. Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs

There have been some theories on this phenomenon, with the most prevalent being the tendency for Wikipedia pages to move up a "classification chain." According to this theory, the Wikipedia Manual of Style guidelines on how to write the lead section of an article recommend that the article should start by defining the topic of the article, so that the first link of each page will naturally take the reader into a broader subject, eventually ending in wide-reaching pages such as Mathematics, Science, Language, and of course, Philosophy, nicknamed the "mother of all sciences".
